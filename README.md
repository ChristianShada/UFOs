# UFOs - The Truth is Out There
### _Overview of the Analysis_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this analysis we are taking data created to document anomalies that have happened within the US. The data includes all the details to the event. With this analysis, we are also enables to search by date, city, state, country and shape. Yes shape. This will hels identify when and where. Going forward, this is soemthing that will allow anyone to enter in data in the form and the website will continue to grow with the. <br>

### _Results:_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the ability to continually add data into the data.js, we will be able to continually collect data and keep this site running. Just so long as users complete the fields similar to the format below to include datetime, city, state,etc. This will continue to keep this website fresh and not become a stale and unused site.

### _Summary:_
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this design is useful for gathering data, it is a lttle cumbersome in entering in data. Ideally we should be able to add/extract in the same place. I would recommend having a link towards the top that would allow for adding data that would fuel the data that you can search for. By doing so, you are not only retaining people at the website. But it would make it very easy for people to enter in data, rather than entering it into a differnt file and then running the file into the website.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more item that would help make this a more emjoyable experience would be to allow people to share photos. When people are looking for new objects in the sky or trying to compare what they see with others' are seeing, it is much easier to see what they see and not read what they are seeing.<br>

until then.....the truth is out there...
